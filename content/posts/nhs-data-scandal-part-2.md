The missing records didn't disappear by magic. They were the result of systemic failures in how the NHS manages its digital infrastructure—failures that experts had warned about for years.

## Legacy Systems Under Strain

Many NHS trusts are still running software that dates back to the early 2000s. These systems were never designed for the scale and complexity of modern healthcare.

"We're essentially running a 21st-century health service on 20th-century technology," explains one senior IT manager who spoke on condition of anonymity.

## The Integration Problem

When the NHS tried to modernise, it created new problems. Different systems needed to talk to each other, but the integration was rushed.

### Critical Failures Identified

1. **No automatic backups** for transferred data
2. **Insufficient logging** of system changes
3. **No reconciliation checks** after data migration
4. **Unclear data ownership** between systems

## Whistleblowers Speak Out

Two IT professionals who worked on the integration project agreed to share their concerns:

> "We raised red flags during testing. We were told to push ahead anyway. The deadline was more important than getting it right."
> <cite>Former NHS IT Contractor</cite>

## The Warning Signs

Internal documents obtained by our investigation show that problems were flagged as early as 2022. Yet no meaningful action was taken.

### Timeline of Ignored Warnings

- **March 2022**: Initial audit flags data inconsistencies
- **July 2022**: IT team submits formal risk assessment
- **November 2022**: Trust board informed of potential issues
- **January 2023**: Problem escalated to regional level
- **2024**: Records continue to disappear

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just a technical failure—it's a governance failure. The systems meant to catch these problems didn't work.

In Part 3, we examine the accountability gap and ask: who is responsible, and what needs to change?
