In early 2024, a routine audit at a major NHS trust uncovered something troubling: patient records were disappearing. Not being deleted with proper protocols—simply vanishing without a trace.

## The Discovery

The first signs emerged during a cross-referencing exercise between two hospital systems. A data analyst noticed discrepancies in patient counts that couldn't be explained by normal variation.

"We expected some minor differences," she told me during our first interview. "But we were seeing gaps of hundreds of records. It didn't make sense."

## What We Know So Far

Our investigation has uncovered a pattern of data loss across multiple NHS trusts. The implications for patient safety are significant.

### Key Findings

1. Over 5,000 patient records affected across 12 trusts
2. No clear documentation of why records were removed
3. Some records relate to ongoing treatment plans
4. The issue spans at least 18 months

## The Human Cost

Behind every missing record is a real patient. Some have found themselves arriving at appointments only to be told their medical history doesn't exist in the system.

## Next Steps

In Part 2 of this investigation, we'll examine the technical failures that allowed this to happen, and speak to the whistleblowers who first raised the alarm.
