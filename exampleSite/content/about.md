Matt Kneale is an emergency medicine clinical fellow and Co-chair of the [Doctors' Association UK (DAUK)](https://dauk.org), a grassroots organisation representing and defending doctors across the United Kingdom. He has been a passionate advocate for doctors' rights and patient safety since joining DAUK in March 2020.

## Advocacy & Leadership

As Co-chair, Matt works to address critical issues facing the NHS workforce, including chronic understaffing, doctor burnout, and the erosion of professional standards. He has been a vocal critic of policies that compromise patient safety, from inadequate staffing levels to the unregulated expansion of physician associate roles.

> "With chronic underfunding and decreasing staffing across the board, on the background of a major pandemic, it is no wonder that doctors are facing burnout at unprecedented levels. This is a national health crisis."

## Media & Public Engagement

Matt regularly contributes to national discussions on healthcare policy, appearing on BBC Radio 4, LBC News, and in The Times. His commentary focuses on the realities of frontline medicine and the systemic challenges facing the NHS.

## Ward & Westminster

This site explores the intersection of medicine, technology, and politics—the forces that shape how healthcare is delivered, who delivers it, and what it means to be a doctor in modern Britain.
